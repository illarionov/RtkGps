	US/Canada/France/New Zealand Datum Shifting Files
	-------------------------------------------------

To build, and install proj with US NAD83/NAD27 datum shifting support, it
is necessary to place these in the proj/nad directory before configuring,
building, and installing proj.

These files should work with pretty much any version of PROJ.4, but are
known to work with PROJ 4.3.x through PROJ 4.6.x.
