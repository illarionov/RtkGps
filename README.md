* Upload Log/Solution to Dropbox if Sync to Dropbox is ticked in the FileSettings screen. (the sync occurs after the stop of the server)
* Ability to zip files before uploading to Dropbox for reducing the data volume.
* Generate a GPX track (Output view/GPX Track tab)

#### Proj4
* Due to multiple issues (error in projection and lacks of features) Proj4J was removed and C lib proj4 was added
* All conversion are done with proj4 5.1.0
* French projections are done with IGN certified method, Lambert II extended is computed with IGN certified grid ntf_r93.gsb
* One custom proj4 specification string can be specified (take care of exact syntax).  
* all standard proj4 formats and grids are included, all grids from http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.7.zip are also included. In other words you have access to this external files: alaska, chenyx06etrs.gsb, conus, epsg,esri, esri.extra, FL, GL27, hawaii, IGNF, MD, nad27, nad83, ntf_r93.gsb, ntv1_can.dat, null, nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb, other.extra, proj_def.dat, prvi, stgeorge, strlnc, stpaul, TN, WI, WO, world, BETA2007.gsb, egm96_15.gtx
* If you need another specific "free" or freely distributable grid or definition file, do not hesitate to drop me an email.

#### Geoids
* you can select different geoid model in "Solution Option"/Geoid model but except for embedded model (EGM96 1째x1째)  
     
  After receiving some emails for asking me how to install the geoid model, I added a new menu "Tools" in this menu you can automatically download and install
  some geoid models. Take attention to the size! I think you may prefer to download this models via a Wifi connection rather than with your data plan!  
    

  you will need to place the corresponding model in the RtkGps storage (probably /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps)  
  the model format is RTKLIB dependent, check jni/RTKLIB/src/geoid.c  
  the model file MUST be one of:  
  ```
    EGM96_M150.geoid  
    EGM2008_M25.geoid  
    EGM2008_M10.geoid  
    GSI2000_M15.geoid
    RAF09_M15x20.geoid  
  ```
  
  for example if you want to use EGM2008 2.5'x2.5' model you need:
  ```
    1.  download from National Geospatial Intelligence Agency the model  
  			  on august 2014 file can be found http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/Small_Endian/Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE.gz   
    2.  extract the Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE file and rename it EGM2008_M25.geoid (149Mo)   
    3.  place this model in RtkGps storage path (where all the trace and log go), on my tools it is /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps/
  ```

  for example if you want to use IGN RAF09 1.5'x2.5' model you need:
  ```
    1.  download from IGN wich is the french national geographical institute the model  
  			  on august 2014 file can be found http://geodesie.ign.fr/contenu/fichiers/documentation/grilles/metropole/RAF09.mnt   
    2.  rename it RAF09_M15x20.geoid    
    3.  place this model in RtkGps storage path (where all the trace and log go), on my tools it is /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps/
  ```
   
  if you do not have the correct model or if model is inconsistent it will not show an error, rather than it will use the EGM96 1째x1째 embedded model or it use ellipsoidal height.
  				
#### Precise ephemeris
If you need precise ephemeris you have 2 ways for using them:  
* Manualy: In the correction tab you select "File" and type SP3 , in the filename you put the filename of the file you provide in RtkGps directory (ending with .SP3)  
* Automatically: When the server is running, hit the "Tools" menu, here you have an option to download and inject automatically the latest ultra-rapid ephemeris from IGS or simply inject them if you already have the good file.  
  
#### NTRIP Caster  
This is highly experimental, but I embedded NTRIP Caster 0.1.5. It works but I'm not satisfied of the implementation. Because it cannot shutdown cleanly.  
Why?  
* 1- because closing connections does not work at 100% (even in original soft), so thread do not end at 100%  
* 2- because by conception of the original Caster the end is not clean, it waits for Control-C for ending and ends with exit(1)!!!    
* 3- because Android lacks some pthread functions (ie: real pthread_cancel...)  

So I locked the ability to stop the NTRIP Caster without closing RTKGPS+.  
But if you want to test it works, on the first launch 2 files are created in RtkGps/ntripcaster/  ,you can edit them, But as is it works and can provide 3 streams:  
```
/GNSS0
/GNSS1
/GNSS2
(all three sources have rtkgps as password)
```
for using with the log streams you need to set them:  
```
server: 127.0.0.1
mountpoint: GNSSx
password: rtkgps (please change it)  
```
On your wifi network you can use your stream on:
```
ntrip://username:password@ip_shown_in_caster_options:2101/GNSSx
(please change the login and the password) 
```
#### Building on Windows
Android is Unix so it is easier to build under an Unix system. Personnaly I use MacOSX but it can be done under Windows (tested under 8.1 x86_64).  
You need a correctly installed ndk (under windows I use ndk-r9d), a correctly Installed ADT (I use x86_64-20140702).  
Also you will need a working Cygwin installation with make, gcc-core gcc-c++ bash at least.  
Define ANDOID_NDK and ANDROID_SDK variable to their correct paths, also add ANDROID_NDK path in PATH
```  
copy RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\INCLUDE\*.h to:  
 RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\SRC  
 RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\INSTALL  
 RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\BLAS\SRC  
```   
This is a workaround for the symlinks.  
You also need to deactivate the use of lapack since it cannot be build under windows.  
For that please modify RtkGps/jni/rtklib.mk and Android.mk for removing LAPACK flag and clapck module import (with performance issues).  
now under a cygwin terminal move to your RtkGps directory and build with ```ndk-build``` command.  
Under Eclipse be sure that you do not set to build the native library since it fails.
