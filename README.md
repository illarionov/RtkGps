* Upload Log/Solution to Dropbox if Sync to Dropbox is ticked in the FileSettings screen. (the sync occurs after the stop of the server)
* Ability to zip files before uploading to Dropbox for reducing the data volume.
* Generate a GPX track (Output view/GPX Track tab)
* Show UTM coordinates in solution view

#### Proj4
* Due to multiple issues (error in projection and lacks of features) Proj4J was removed and C lib proj4 was added
* All conversion are done with proj4 5.1.0
* French projections are done with IGN certified method, Lambert II extended is computed with IGN certified grid ntf_r93.gsb
* One custom proj4 specification string can be specified (take care of exact syntax).  
* all standard proj4 formats and grids are included, all grids from http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.7.zip are also included. In other words you have access to this external files: alaska, chenyx06etrs.gsb, conus, epsg,esri, esri.extra, FL, GL27, hawaii, IGNF, MD, nad27, nad83, ntf_r93.gsb, ntv1_can.dat, null, nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb, other.extra, proj_def.dat, prvi, stgeorge, strlnc, stpaul, TN, WI, WO, world, BETA2007.gsb, egm96_15.gtx
* If you need another specific "free" or freely distributable grid or definition file, do not hesitate to drop me an email.

#### Geoids
* you can select different geoid model in "Solution Option"/Geoid model but except for embedded model (EGM96 1°x1°)  
     
  After receiving some emails for asking me how to install the geoid model, I added a new menu "Tools" in this menu you can automatically download and install
  some geoid models. Take attention to the size! I think you may prefer to download this models via a Wifi connection rather than with your data plan!  
    

  you will need to place the corresponding model in the RtkGps storage (probably /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps)  
  the model format is RTKLIB dependent, check jni/RTKLIB/src/geoid.c  
  the model file MUST be one of:  
  ```
    EGM96_M150.geoid  
    EGM2008_M25.geoid  
    EGM2008_M10.geoid  
    GSI2000_M15.geoid
    RAF09_M15x20.geoid  
  ```
  
  for example if you want to use EGM2008 2.5'x2.5' model you need:
  ```
    1.  download from National Geospatial Intelligence Agency the model  
  			  on august 2014 file can be found http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/Small_Endian/Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE.gz   
    2.  extract the Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE file and rename it EGM2008_M25.geoid (149Mo)   
    3.  place this model in RtkGps storage path (where all the trace and log go), on my tools it is /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps/
  ```

  for example if you want to use IGN RAF09 1.5'x2.5' model you need:
  ```
    1.  download from IGN wich is the french national geographical institute the model  
  			  on august 2014 file can be found http://geodesie.ign.fr/contenu/fichiers/documentation/grilles/metropole/RAF09.mnt   
    2.  rename it RAF09_M15x20.geoid    
    3.  place this model in RtkGps storage path (where all the trace and log go), on my tools it is /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps/
  ```
   
  if you do not have the correct model or if model is inconsistent it will not show an error, rather than it will use the EGM96 1°x1° embedded model or it use ellipsoidal height.
  				
#### Precise ephemeris
If you need precise ephemeris you have 2 ways for using them:  
* Manualy: In the correction tab you select "File" and type SP3 , in the filename you put the filename of the file you provide in RtkGps directory (ending with .SP3)  
* Automatically: When the server is running, hit the "Tools" menu, here you have an option to download and inject automatically the latest ultra-rapid ephemeris from IGS or simply inject them if you already have the good file.  
  
#### NTRIP Caster  
This is highly experimental, but I embedded NTRIP Caster 0.1.5. It works but I'm not satisfied of the implementation. Because it cannot shutdown cleanly.  
Why?  
* 1- because closing connections does not work at 100% (even in original soft), so thread do not end at 100%  
* 2- because by conception of the original Caster the end is not clean, it waits for Control-C for ending and ends with exit(1)!!!    
* 3- because Android lacks some pthread functions (ie: real pthread_cancel...)  

So I locked the ability to stop the NTRIP Caster without closing RTKGPS+.  
But if you want to test it works, on the first launch 2 files are created in RtkGps/ntripcaster/  ,you can edit them, But as is it works and can provide 3 streams:  
```
/GNSS0
/GNSS1
/GNSS2
(all three sources have rtkgps as password)
```
for using with the log streams you need to set them:  
```
server: 127.0.0.1
mountpoint: GNSSx
password: rtkgps (please change it)  
```
On your wifi network you can use your stream on:
```
ntrip://username:password@ip_shown_in_caster_options:2101/GNSSx
(please change the login and the password) 
```
#### Building on Windows
Android is Unix so it is easier to build under an Unix system. Personnaly I use MacOSX but it can be done under Windows (tested under 8.1 x86_64).  
You need a correctly installed ndk (under windows I use ndk-r9d), a correctly Installed ADT (I use x86_64-20140702).  
Also you will need a working Cygwin installation with make, gcc-core gcc-c++ bash at least.  
Define ANDOID_NDK and ANDROID_SDK variable to their correct paths, also add ANDROID_NDK path in PATH
```  
copy RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\INCLUDE\*.h to:  
 RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\SRC  
 RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\INSTALL  
 RtkGps\jni\simonlynen_android_libs\lapack\jni\clapack\BLAS\SRC  
```   
This is a workaround for the symlinks.  
You also need to deactivate the use of lapack since it cannot be build under windows.  
For that please modify RtkGps/jni/rtklib.mk and Android.mk for removing LAPACK flag and clapck module import (with performance issues).  
now under a cygwin terminal move to your RtkGps directory and build with ```ndk-build``` command.  
Under Eclipse be sure that you do not set to build the native library since it fails.

###### Binary distribution

* the latest apk with Mobile Mapper 50 and proj4 5.1.0 wich is maybe very instable can be found in bin directory, but prefer the Google Play version

###### Beta distribution

* the build 18 / 08 / 2018 (1.0alpha26) has been deployed as "BETA" on Google Play Store it is an open beta… If you want try it, but don't blame if it does not work.
